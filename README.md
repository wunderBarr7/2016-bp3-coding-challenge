# 2016-bp3-coding-challenge

This submission was written in Node.js and can be run with the command:
`node BP3CodingChallenge2016.js <FILE_PATH> -t`
Where both `<FILE_PATH>` and `-t` are optional arguments: order does not matter.

`<FILE_PATH>` - File path to JSON file with the same format as the one provided. Defaults to `diagram.json`.
`-t` - Including this flag will run unit tests. **Note this requires both of the testing files from this repository.

Running the submission in Node.js will output the solution to the console in JSON.
